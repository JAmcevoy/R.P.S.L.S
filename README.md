# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

[R.P.S.L.S](https://jamcevoy.github.io/R.P.S.L.S/)

R.P.S.L.S is my spin on the sitcom favourite game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

My aims for this game is that it will be accessavle to mulitple ages groups with a easy to understand design and fun little throw back to the show. Like for example your opponent is the mighty Sheldon Cooper.

## User Needs

- I would want the game to be accessible from different devices (Phone, Laptop, PC, Tablet).
- It would need to be responsive to all screens, ensuring the information is readable and understandable.
- As a user, I would want to see easy to understand control, with good use of white space.
- I would need a section where the rule would be displayed at all times.
- Somewhere to keep score.

## Rules 

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

![Chrome]()

![Firefox]()

![Microsoft Edge]()

![Safari]()

- I confirmed the site was responsive using the Chrome dev tools device toolbar.
- I can confirm that the nav and social links are reliable and easy to understand, Also the social links open in a new tab and open apps on mobile phones.
- I have confirmed the forms work, required entries in every field, the Radio button requires at least one to be selected, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit button works.
- I have asked some family and friends to try the websites on a PC, laptop, and mobile phone (Andriod and iPhone).

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
